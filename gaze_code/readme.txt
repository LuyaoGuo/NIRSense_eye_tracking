> Firstly, run the file 'gaze_animation_full_term.py' to start the experiment.
  The data including the eye signals recorded from the NIRSense glasses as well as
  the baseline data will be recorded and saved with titled 'sensor_data_.csv' and 
  'dot_data_.csv' separately.
> Second, run the file 'training_and_accuracy_evaluation.py' to finish the signal preprocessing, 
  signal processing and results evaluation.
